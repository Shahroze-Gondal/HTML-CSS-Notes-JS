Good Expectation:
Overview:
Great Expectations is a Python-based open-source library for validating, documenting, and profiling your data. It helps you to maintain data quality and improve communication about data between teams. Software developers have long known that automated testing is essential for managing complex codebases.

Key features:
Expectations

Expectations are assertions about your data. In Great Expectations, those assertions are expressed in a declarative language in the form of simple, human-readable Python methods. For example, in order to assert that you want the column “passenger_count” to be between 1 and 6, you can say:

expect_column_values_to_be_between(column="passenger_count", min_value=1, max_value=6)

Great Expectations then uses this statement to validate whether the column passenger_count in a given table is indeed between 1 and 6, and returns a success or failure result. The library currently provides several dozen highly expressive built-in Expectations, and allows you to write custom Expectations.
